# Main configuration file for Zsh Modular Configuration
# This file is copied to ~/.zsh/zshrc during installation

# Configuration files are organized in the conf.d directory with a numbered prefix scheme:
# - 01-09: Core system variables and early initialization
# - 10-19: Basic shell options and settings
# - 20-29: Plugin management and completions
# - 30-39: UI/Theme and aliases
# - 40-49: Functions and OS-specific configurations
# - 50+: User customizations and local settings

# Load all configuration files from conf.d in numerical order
for config_file in ~/.zsh/conf.d/[0-9]*-*.zsh; do
  # Skip macOS setup on non-macOS systems
  if [[ "$config_file" == *"macos_setup"* && "$OSTYPE" != "darwin"* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  
  # Skip local.zsh.template (it's just a template)
  if [[ "$config_file" == *"local.zsh.template" ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  
  # Source the configuration file
  source "$config_file"
done

# Load local configuration if it exists
